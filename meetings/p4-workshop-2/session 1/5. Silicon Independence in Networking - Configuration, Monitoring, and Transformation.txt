Silicon Independence in Networking: Configuration, Monitoring, and Transformation
Achieving switch silicon independence is appealing for cloud vendors because it enables separation of concerns. Ideally, network fabrics can be built from forwarding silicon that provides the best combination of: raw forwarding speed, scale, and latency for a minimum level of  monitoring and packet stream transformation. Doing so requires: i) a standard software stack to run local services and to manage local configuration; ii) a standard forwarding model to express what switch monitoring means; and iii) a standard calculus to express the set of transformations supported on individual packets. The community is making good progress on the first goal of standardizing the software stack. In this talk, we argue for the benefits and challenges associated with the second two requirements. Today, switches export such wildly different monitoring and transformation capabilities that developers are forced to either push functionality to the programmable edge of the network or to customize the entire hardware/software stack to the APIs and capabilities of a single vendor.

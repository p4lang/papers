This talk will overview recent activity on the design of the P4 language.  In particular, this will cover the release of the P4 1.1 specification, and discuss the main changes being proposed for the future P4 1.2 specification.  Two important features of P4 1.2 will be architecture-language separation, and the use of libraries to replace various capabilities currently built into the syntax of the language as special cases.

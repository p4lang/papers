The Paxos protocol is the foundation for building many fault-tolerant distributed systems and services. This talk posits that there are significant performance benefits to be gained by implementing Paxos logic in network devices. Until recently, the notion of a switch-based implementation of Paxos would be a daydream. However, new flexible hardware and expressive data plane programming languages are on the horizon and will provide customizable packet processing pipelines needed to implement Paxos. This talk describes an implementation of Paxos in one of those languages, P4, as well as our on-going efforts to evaluate the implementation on a variety of hardware devices. Implementing Paxos provides a critical use case for P4, and will help drive the requirements for data plane languages in general. In the long term, we imagine that consensus could someday be offered as a network service, just as point-to-point communication is provided today.

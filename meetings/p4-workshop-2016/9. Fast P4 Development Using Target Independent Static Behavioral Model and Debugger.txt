Behavioral Model v2 (BMv2) is a P4 Software Switch that is unlike it's predecessor the Behavioral Model (BM) in that it does not need to be recompiled every time the P4 program changes. This allows for faster development and debugging of P4 programs. This new model also allows developers to model various target architectures as opposed to the abstract forwarding model BM was using. The newly integrated debugger allows for runtime debugging of P4 programs therefore cutting short the debug time and improving the overall P4 experience.

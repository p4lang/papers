Smart Network Interface Cards (SmartNICs) are increasingly being deployed in cloud datacenters to offload inline network processing tasks from server CPUs, thereby improving system throughput while freeing up server CPU cycles for application processing. The match/action and tunnel handling semantics of SmartNIC datapaths can be either expressed directly in the P4 language or be defined by virtual switching software like Open vSwitch (implementing the semantics of a specification like OpenFlow). This presentation compares these approaches, considering aspects like the expressiveness and performance of the resulting datapath as well as the characteristics of the associated run-time interfaces.
